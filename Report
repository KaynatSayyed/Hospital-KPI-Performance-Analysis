Hospital KPI Performance Analysis (2020–2024)

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate three critical hospital KPIs:
Bed Occupancy Rate
Fall Rate per 1,000 patient days
Staff Responsiveness Score
The project identifies patterns, benchmark gaps, and drivers influencing patient safety and service quality.

Objectives
Ensure clean, consistent, and analysis-ready KPI data
Analyze 3-year trends and compare performance with national benchmarks
Identify relationships between KPIs such as occupancy and fall rate
Build a dynamic dashboard for KPI monitoring
Provide actionable insights for improving hospital operations

Tools & Technologies
Excel (Data Cleaning, PivotTables, KPI Calculations)
Power BI (Dashboard, Slicers, Visualizations)
Correlation & Benchmark Analysis

Key Steps Performed
Cleaned & standardized 36 months of KPI data for consistent time-series analysis.
Performed trend analysis revealing 97% average occupancy and below-benchmark responsiveness.
Benchmarked KPIs against national standards to identify performance gaps.
Conducted correlation modelling showing strong links between occupancy and fall rate.
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with visuals and slicers for Year, Quarter, Month.
Prepared insights and recommendations using the STAR reporting method.
Proposed data-driven operational strategies to reduce falls and improve response time.

Insights Generated
High occupancy (97%) contributed to increased fall rates
Staff responsiveness consistently below benchmark (64% vs 65%)
Occupancy showed a strong positive correlation (+0.70) with fall rate
Improving staffing alignment could reduce fall incidents by ~10–12%
